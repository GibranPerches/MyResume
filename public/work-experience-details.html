    <b><h3>Software Engineer II (Jun 2022 - Dec 2023)</h3></b>
    <b>Visteon Queretaro (Hybrid)</b><br/><br/>
    I was owner of Launch Control feature for the 2024 Focus project, thus adding an entire<br/>
    new feature to the car. I learned how to liaise with clients to verify implementation or<br/>
    seek clarification on final product details. I primarily programmed in C, C++, and Python,<br/>
    and conducted code design at both low and high levels, performed system metrics, which<br/>
    included checking boot times, resources consumption, among other tasks.<br/><br/>
    I conducted CAN tests using CANoe or CANalyzer to enhance implementation robustness, worked<br/>
    with virtual machines, also used Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects for the interface<br/>
    asset acquisition and correction. Working alongside my team, I implemented significant changes<br/>
    to the software architecture of our project, under the AUTOSAR standard to reduce load<br/>
    times and optimize communication between the application, UI core, and the final interface.

    <b><h3>Software Engineer I (Nov 2021 - Jun 2022)</h3></b>
    <b>Visteon Queretaro (Hybrid)</b><br/><br/>
    I was part of the HMI development team, where I worked on the UI core area, responsible<br/>
    for receiving data from the application. My responsibilities included processing and<br/>
    re-typing this data to generate a data source for animations, such as the speedometer,<br/>
    tachometer, warning, telltales, indicators, information on-demand , among others. I primarily<br/>
    developed in C and C++, using JAZZ as a version control tool.<br/><br/>
    I employed methodologies and processes from the SDLC to guide software development in<br/>
    past projects. This involved participating in all stages of the lifecycle, from gathering<br/>
    and analyzing requirements to implementation, testing, and maintenance. This experience<br/>
    enabled me to work collaboratively in cross-functional teams and ensure delivery time and<br/>
    final product quality.
